Why I didn't get paid

Technical issues happen a lot during Start of Year, 
which makes a handful of transactions to fail, 
sometimes due to systems or network issues, 
or due to the bulk of transactions processed at that time, 
etc, 
it is not possible for us to know all the reasons why, 
but I can confirm that it has nothing to do with your particular record, 
so your payments should be fine going forward.
